# ChatGPT-Chrome-Extension 🤖 ✨
ChatGPT Chrome Extension using Nodejs

A Chrome extension that adds [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) to every text box on the internet! Use it to write tweets, revise emails, fix coding bugs, or whatever else you need, all without leaving the site you're on. Includes a plugin system for greater control over ChatGPT behavior and ability to interact with 3rd party APIs.

## Install

First clone this repo on your local machine

Then install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Copy `.env-example` into a new file named `.env` and add your ChatGPT API Key.

Run the server so the extension can communicate with ChatGPT.

```bash
node server.js
```

This will automate interaction with ChatGPT through OpenAI's API.

Add the extension

1. Go to chrome://extensions in your Google Chrome browser
2. Check the Developer mode checkbox in the top right-hand corner
3. Click "Load Unpacked" to see a file-selection dialog
4. Select your local `ChatGPT-Chrome-Extension/extension` directory

You'll now see "Ask ChatGPT" if you right click in any text input or content editable area.

## Troubleshooting

If ChatGPT is taking a very long time to respond or not responding at all then it could mean that their servers are currently overloaded. You can confirm this by going to [chat.openai.com/chat](https://chat.openai.com/chat) and seeing whether their website works directly.

## Plugins

Plugins have the ability to inform ChatGPT of specific conversation rules and parse replies from ChatGPT before they are sent to the browser.

[Default](/plugins/Default.js) - Sets some default conversation rules 🧑‍🏫

[Image](/plugins/Image.js) - Tells ChatGPT to describe things visually when asked for an image and then replaces the description with a matching AI generated image from [Lexica](http://lexica.art) 📸

Your really cool plugin - Go make a plugin, do a pull-request and I'll add it the list 🤝
