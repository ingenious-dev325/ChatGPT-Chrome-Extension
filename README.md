# ChatGPT-Chrome-Extension ðŸ¤– âœ¨
ChatGPT Chrome Extension using Nodejs

A Chrome extension that adds [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) to every text box on the internet! Use it to write tweets, revise emails, fix coding bugs, or whatever else you need, all without leaving the site you're on. Includes a plugin system for greater control over ChatGPT behavior and ability to interact with 3rd party APIs.

## Install

First clone this repo on your local machine

Then install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Copy `.env-example` into a new file named `.env` and add your ChatGPT API Key.

Run the server so the extension can communicate with ChatGPT.

```bash
node server.js
```

This will automate interaction with ChatGPT through OpenAI's API, thanks to the [chatgpt-api](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api) library.
